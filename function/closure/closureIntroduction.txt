# closure is dynamically created function which is returned by other function

In case of closure, variable in the enclosing function's scope is retained even after the function call is over

# For closure following three things must be true-
  a) there must be nesting of functions
  b) inner function must refer to the variable in the scope of outer function
  c) outer function must return inner function
